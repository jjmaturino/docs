title: Factuality
---

You can get factuality scores (or rather factual consistency scores) from the
`/factuality` REST API endpoint or any of the official SDKs (Python, Go, Rust,
JS, or cURL).

The output will include a `score` that ranges from 0.0 to 1.0. The higher the
score, the more factuality consistency between the `text` and the `reference`.

## Generate a Factuality Score

To generate a factuality score, you can use the following code examples.
Depending on your preference or requirements, select the appropriate method
for your application.

    <CodeBlock title="Python">
    ```python filename="main.py"
    import os
    import json

    from predictionguard import PredictionGuard

    # Set your Prediction Guard token as an environmental variable.
    os.environ["PREDICTIONGUARD_API_KEY"] = "<api key>"
    
    client = PredictionGuard()

    # Perform the factual consistency check.
    result = client.factuality.check(
        		reference="The sky is blue.",
        		text="The sky is green."
    )

    print(json.dumps(
        result,

        separators=(',', ': ')

		"reference": "The sky is blue.",

The output will look something like:

```json
{
    "checks": [
        {
            "index": 0,
            "score": 0.26569077372550964
        }
    ]
    "id": "fact-5a364943-c990-44af-9b59-712a4a23e06f",
    "object": "factuality.check",
    "created": 1727795218,
}
```

This approach presents a straightforward way for readers to choose and apply the
code example that best suits their needs for generating text completions using
either Python, Go, Rust, JS, or cURL.
