title: Factuality
---

You can get factuality scores (or rather factual consistency scores) from the `/factuality` endpoint or `Factuality` class in the Python client. This endpoint/Class takes two parameters:

- `reference` - A reference text with which you want to compare another text for factual consistency.
- `text` - The candidate text that will be scored for factual consistency.

The output will include a `score` that ranges from 0.0 to 1.0. The higher the score, the more factuality consistency between the `text` and the `reference`.

## Generate a factuality score

To generate a factuality score, you can use the following code examples. Depending on your preference or requirements, select the appropriate method for your application.

<CodeBlocks>
    <CodeBlock title="Python">
    ```python filename="main.py"
    import os
    import json

    import predictionguard as pg

    # Set your Prediction Guard token as an environmental variable.
    os.environ["PREDICTIONGUARD_TOKEN"] = "<your access token>"

    # Perform the factual consistency check.
    result = pg.Factuality.check(
        		reference="The sky is blue",
        		text="The sky is green"
    )

    print(json.dumps(
        result,
        sort_keys=True,
        indent=4,
        separators=(',', ': ')
    ))
    ```
    </CodeBlock>
    <CodeBlock title="cURL">
    ```bash
    $ curl --location --request POST 'https://api.predictionguard.com/factuality' \
    --header 'x-api-key: <your access token>' \
    --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    --data-raw '{
        "reference":"The sky is blue",
    		"text":"The sky is green"
    }'
    ```
    </CodeBlock>

</CodeBlocks>

The output will look something like:

```json
{
  "checks": [
    {
      "score": 0.12404686957597733,
      "index": 0,
      "status": "success"
    }
  ],
  "created": 1701721456,
  "id": "fact-O0CdxbefFwSRo7uypla7hdUka3pPf",
  "object": "factuality_check"
}
```
