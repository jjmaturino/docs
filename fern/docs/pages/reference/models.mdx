## List Models
Here is how to list all the models available in the Prediction Guard platform.
This functionality allows you to view the available models, their capabilities, context length,
and more. You can also filter by capabilities by setting the `capability` parameter.
Available options are `chat-completion, chat-with-image, completion, embedding, embedding-with-image, and tokenize.

<CodeBlocks>
    <CodeBlock title="Python">
        ```python
        import os
        import json

        from predictionguard import PredictionGuard

        # Set your Prediction Guard token as an environmental variable.
        os.environ["PREDICTIONGUARD_API_KEY"] = "<api key>"

        client = PredictionGuard()

        # Leave capability blank for all models,
        # otherwise a capability can be added to filter available models.
        response = client.models.list(
            capability=""
        )

        print(json.dumps(
        response,
        sort_keys=True,
        indent=4,
        separators=(',', ': ')
        ))
        ```
    </CodeBlock>

    <CodeBlock title="Go">
        ```go
        package main

        import (
        "context"
        "fmt"
        "log"
        "os"
        "time"

        "github.com/predictionguard/go-client"
        )

        func main() {
        if err := run(); err != nil {
        log.Fatalln(err)
    }
        ```
    </CodeBlock>

            <CodeBlock title="Rust">
```rust
        extern crate prediction_guard as pg_client;
        ```
    </CodeBlock>

            <CodeBlock title="NodeJS">
```js
        import * as pg from 'predictionguard';

        const client = new pg.Client('https://api.predictionguard.com', process.env.PREDICTIONGUARD_API_KEY);

        ```
    </CodeBlock>

            <CodeBlock title="cURL">
```bash
        curl -i -X POST https://api.predictionguard.com/models \
        -H "Authorization: Bearer ${PREDICTIONGUARD_API_KEY}" \
        -H "Content-Type: application/json"
        ```
    </CodeBlock>
</CodeBlocks>

The output will look something like this.

```json
{
"object": "list",
    "data": [
    {
        "id": "bridgetower-large-itm-mlm-itc",
        "object": "model",
        "created": "2024-10-31T00:00:00Z",
        "owned_by": "Bridgetower",
        "description": "Open source multimodal embeddings model.",
        "max_context_length": 100,
        "prompt_format": "none",
        "capabilities": {
            "chat_completion": false,
            "chat_with_image": false,
            "completion": false,
            "embedding": true,
            "embedding_with_image": true,
            "tokenize": false
        }
    }
    ...
}
        ```

        This approach presents a straightforward way for readers to choose and apply the
        code example that best suits their needs for Prediction Guard using
        either Python, Go, Rust, JS, or cURL.
