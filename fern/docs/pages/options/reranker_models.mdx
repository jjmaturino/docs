Unlike embedding models, rerankers take a query and document (or passage) as input and directly output a similarity score.
The output relevance score can be converted to a float value in the range [0,1] using a sigmoid function.

Key Features:
•	Multilingual Support: Excels across multiple languages with strong cross-lingual capabilities.
•	Efficiency: Lightweight design ensures fast inference and easy deployment.
•	Versatility: Supports a range of use cases and scenarios.

This model offers an excellent balance between performance and deployment efficiency,
making it a powerful choice for a wide range of text retrieval scenarios.
