When sending a request to the Vision models, Prediction Guard offers various options to upload your image. You can upload the image from using a URL, a local image file, data URI, or base64 encoded image.
Here is an example of how to use an image from a URL:

``` Python
import os
import json
from predictionguard import PredictionGuard

# Set your Prediction Guard token as an environmental variable.
os.environ["PREDICTIONGUARD_API_KEY"] = "<api key>"

client = PredictionGuard()

messages = [
    {
        "role": "user",
        "content": [
            {
                "type": "text",
                "text": "What's in this image?"
            },
            {
                "type": "image_url",
                "image_url": {
                    "url": "https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GKLN4qPXEAArqoK.png",
                }
            }
        ]
    },
]

result = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="llava-1.5-7b-hf",
    messages=messages
)

print(json.dumps(
    result,
    sort_keys=True,
    indent=4,
    separators=(',', ': ')
))


```

This example shows how you can upload the image from a local file:

``` Python
import os
import json
from predictionguard import PredictionGuard

# Set your Prediction Guard token as an environmental variable.
os.environ["PREDICTIONGUARD_API_KEY"] = "<api key>"

client = PredictionGuard()

messages = [
    {
        "role": "user",
        "content": [
            {
                "type": "text",
                "text": "What's in this image?"
            },
            {
                "type": "image_url",
                "image_url": {
                    "url": "GKLN4qPXEAArqoK.png",
                }
            }
        ]
    },
]

result = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="llava-1.5-7b-hf",
    messages=messages
)

print(json.dumps(
    result,
    sort_keys=True,
    indent=4,
    separators=(',', ': ')
))


```

When using base64 encoded image inputs or data URIs, you first need to encode the image.

Here is how you convert an image to base64 encoding

```Python
import base64

def encode_image_to_base64(image_path):
    with open(image_path, 'rb') as image_file:
        image_data = image_file.read()
        base64_encoded_data = base64.b64encode(image_data)
        base64_message = base64_encoded_data.decode('utf-8')
        return base64_message

image_path = 'GKLN4qPXEAArqoK.png'
encoded_image = encode_image_to_base64(image_path)

```

This example shows how to enter just the base64 encoded image:

```Python
messages = [
    {
        "role": "user",
        "content": [
            {
                "type": "text",
                "text": "What's in this image?"
            },
            {
                "type": "image_url",
                "image_url": {
                    "url": encoded_image,
                }
            }
        ]
    },
]

result = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="llava-1.5-7b-hf",
    messages=messages
)

print(json.dumps(
    result,
    sort_keys=True,
    indent=4,
    separators=(',', ': ')
))
```

And this example shows how to use a data URI

```Python
data_uri = "data:image/png;base64," + encoded_string

messages = [
    {
        "role": "user",
        "content": [
            {
                "type": "text",
                "text": "What's in this image?"
            },
            {
                "type": "image_url",
                "image_url": {
                    "url": data_uri,
                }
            }
        ]
    },
]

result = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="llava-1.5-7b-hf",
    messages=messages
)

print(json.dumps(
    result,
    sort_keys=True,
    indent=4,
    separators=(',', ': ')
))
```

The output of these will be similar to this:

```json
{
    "choices": [
        {
            "index": 0,
            "message": {
                "content": "In the image, there is a person standing on the back of a vehicle in a city. The vehicle is situated next to a taxi on the street. Another car can be seen approaching, and there is also a traffic light visible in the scene. The person standing on the vehicle could be a man drying his clothes, creating a unique and eye-catching sight. Additionally, a handbag is present near the person riding on the vehicle, likely belonging to them",
                "output": null,
                "role": "assistant"
            }
        }
    ],
