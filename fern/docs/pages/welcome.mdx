<Info>
  An API Definition is a document that defines the structure of the API. It
  includes the **endpoints**, **request and response schemas**, and
  **authentication** requirements.

Prediction Guard has various endpoints designed to derisk LLMs:

    Formerly known as Swagger, [OpenAPI](https://swagger.io/specification/) is the most popular API definition format.
    OpenAPI can be used to document RESTful APIs and is defined in a YAML or JSON file.

    Check out an example OpenAPI Specification for the Petstore API [here](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-petstore/blob/master/src/main/resources/openapi.yaml)

    ```yaml maxLines={0}

    [AsyncAPI](https://v2.asyncapi.com/docs) is a specification for defining event-driven APIs. It is used to document APIs that use 
    WebSockets, MQTT, and other messaging protocols.

    Check out an example AsyncAPI spec for a chat application below:

    ```yaml maxLines={0}
    asyncapi: 2.0.0

  The Fern Definition is our take on a simpler API definition format. It is designed with **best-practices**,
  supports **both RESTful and event-driven APIs**, and is optimized for **SDK generation**.

  <Note>
    The Fern Definition is inspired from internal API Definition formats built at companies like
    [Amazon](https://smithy.io/2.0/index.html), [Google](https://grpc.io/), [Palantir](https://blog.palantir.com/introducing-conjure-palantirs-toolchain-for-http-json-apis-2175ec172d32),
    Twilio and Stripe. These companies **rejected** OpenAPI and built their own version.

Prediction Guard allows you to integrate secure, private GenAI functionality into your
software applications via an easy-to-use API. The API can be self-hosted or accessed via
our managed cloud offering. These docs are relevant to both the self-hosted and managed
cloud offerings (although a self-hosted installation might have a variety of custom
models deployed that are not listed throughout these docs).

**Note - Prediction Guard does NOT save or share any data sent to these models
(or responses from the models). Further, we are able to sign a BAA for customers
needing HIPAA compliance. [Contact support](support) with any questions.**

**Note - We only integrate models that are licensed permissively for commercial
use.**
