Prediction Guard allows you to integrate secure, private GenAI functionality into your
software applications via an easy-to-use API. The API can be self-hosted or accessed via
our managed cloud offering. These docs are relevant to both the self-hosted and managed
cloud offerings (although a self-hosted installation might have a variety of custom
models deployed that are not listed throughout these docs).

**Note - Prediction Guard does NOT save or share any data sent to these models
(or responses from the models). Further, we are able to sign a BAA for customers
needing HIPAA compliance. [Contact support](support) with any questions.**

**Note - We only integrate models that are licensed permissively for commercial
use.**
